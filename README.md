# Event-Driven Samples To Study

This project is intended to help in understanding the Event-Driven architecture and the patterns that compose it. Through samples, you can learn its operation in a practical way.

All samples are in C# language and .Net platform. They can run using Docker through a Dockerfile present in each sample.

Here is a list of samples with code and a short description:

- Sample 01 - Simple **Event-Driven** between two API microservices and RabbitMQ for receiving and emitting events.
- Sample 02 - Using the **CQRS** Pattern in a simple URL Shortener program.
- Sample 03 - Using **Event-Sourcing** in a microservice for client management.
